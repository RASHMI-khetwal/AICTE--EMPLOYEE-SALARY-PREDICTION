This project predicts whether an individual's salary is **above or below \$50K/year** using the Adult Census Income dataset (`adult.csv`). 
The dataset includes features such as age, education, occupation, hours worked per week, etc. Preprocessing steps included handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. 
Machine learning models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Gradient Boosting Classifier**, etc., were implemented. 
Model performance was evaluated using **accuracy**, and Gradient Boosting outperformed Logistic Regression. 
This project demonstrates the use of supervised learning for binary classification on real-world demographic data.
